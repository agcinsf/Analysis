    "<Font FACE= Times><Font Size= 4> <b>Introduction<p> </b>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "       The University of California, Berkeley and San Francisco have strategic relationships with core suppliers through which its students, faculty, and staff do routine business. The daily operations of UCSF and UC Berkeley are fueled by the constant procurement of goods and services off of an e-commerce system called BearBuy. It is through this system that suppliers are enabled to host product catalogs. The Procurement department is responsible for determining the impact of the suggested pricing. Through an analysis of the proposed catalogs, the University gains visibility into any future price increases or product removals and determines if the proposed catalog is acceptable to be purchased off of.\n",
    "           <p>\n",
    "<t>\n",
    "<b> The Analysis:</b>\n",
    "<p>  <t>    The several hosted catalogs all offer an abundant amount of products, ranging from a few thousand to over a million line items. In order to understand relevant product changes, the previous 12 months worth of campus spend through that supplier is matched up against both the current and proposed catalog. This narrows down the entirety of the catalog to the relevant products of which the campus purchases. From the past 12 month spend, the analysis determines whether or not there are price increases through the proposed catalog and if the supplier is following the terms of their contract. \n",
    "    \n",
    "<p>Currently, the analysis does not take into account products of which the university has never purchased. The simple assumption that past historical spend accurately reflects forecasted purchases allows for an opportunity in an improvement in the analysis.</p><br>\n",
    "        \n",
    "<b>Benefits of Using Python/PANDAS:</b>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "The routine review of proposed catalogs, the limits of Excel and time consumption of repeated manual analysis make an automated process that can  analyze and tackle the large amount data extremeley valuable. Python, and more specifically, PANDAS, is an excellent tool to run this continued analysis of determining potential price increases from the suppliers.\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "    PANDAS allows for the easy manipulation of dataframes and the content within. The analyst inputs the correct file location of the catalogs to be analyzed as well as notes the specific campus and supplier. The code uses this data to ouptput all of the necessary content for determining if a price file is appropriate into a running log. This not only yields instant visibility into the impact of a catalog, but continuously organizes the results chronologically for easy recall.\n",
